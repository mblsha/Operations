/**
    Attach a `LoggingObserver to an operation to log when the operation
    start, produces new operation and finsihed. It doesn't yet report
    detailed error infomation.

    Any produced `Operation` instances will automatically get their
    own logger attached.
    
    - queue: Provide a queue, by detault it uses it's own serial queue.
    - logger: Provide a logging block. By detault the logger uses `println`
    however, for custom loggers provide a block which receives a `String`.

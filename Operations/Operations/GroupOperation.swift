/**
    An `Operation` subclass which enables the grouping
    of other operations. Use `GroupOperation`s to associate
    related operations together, thereby creating higher
    levels of abstractions.

    Additionally, `GroupOperation`s are useful as a way
    of creating Operations which may repeat themselves before
    subsequent operations can run. For example, authentication
    operations.
